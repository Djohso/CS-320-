# CS-320- Software Test and Automation

- To ensure that my code is functional and secure, I can use various testing methods to check different parts of the code's functionality and organization.  JUnit tests are good at finding and testing exceptions and likely errors to occur,
  as well as providing a coverage percentage that aids in determining how much of the program has been tested.  Additionally, reading the code and finding errors related to requirements is a good way to make sure that the organization of the
  program makes logical sense, and that the program satisfies the prerequisites of the requirements.  To ensure that the program is secure, it is good practice to use a Mavin Dependency plugin to look for vulnerabilities within the program,
  which will also provide information on found vulnerabilities including reccomendations to circumvent or mitigate them.

- It is important to imagine yourself as a user of the program you are creating in order to anticipate their needs once the program is completed.  The initial requirements is a great start to determine the needs of future users, however going
  the extra mile by considering what other features may make the program more user friendly and streamlined would be a great way to ensure that user needs are met and satisfied by the program.

- To approach designing software, it is more common to take time to test as you go, and be open to changes that may come.  Since new and unexpected requirements may be introduced along the development path, it would do well to be ready to make
  changes and change course when and if that occurs.  By taking this dynamic approach, you will be more likely to succeed in satisfying customer needs, and not getting stuck in the pre-determined development plan that may be outdated soon after
  it has begun.
